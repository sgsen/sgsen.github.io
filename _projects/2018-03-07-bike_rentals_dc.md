The challenge in this project was to apply some of the machine learning techniques to a practical problem.

In this case to try and predict hourly bike rentals for Washington DC's Capital Bikeshare program. I got the absolute mean error to about 30 and the root mean square error to about 50 (the average rentals per hour were about 190). Both using a random forests.
