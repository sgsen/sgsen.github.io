As you know I have been struggling with communications lately. And I thought I'd revisit the classic text.

I read this book back in 2002-3. And it definitively changed my life. I remember Professor Haimes gave us these books after a particularly dysfunctional research team meeting. It lead to me really rethinking my own life. I owe much of the good that's happened afterwards to that book. I still have that copy somewhere. While in India I'm referring to a Kindle version.

# Habit 5: Principles of Empathic Communication

> If I were to summarize in one sentence the single most important principle I have learned int eh field of interpersonal relations, it would be this: **Seek first to understand, then to be understood.** This principle is the key to effective interpersonal communication.


## Diagnose before you Prescribe
You'll find that in all fields, it's critical to diagnose before you prescribe. Medicine obviously, but also pretty much anything you can think of. The law. Engineering. Finance. Here recall the 5 step problem solving process at Bridgewater.

### The parable of the glasses

Goes something like this. My words here from memory.

'Doctor I can't see,' says the patient.

'Oh well, I had this problem once. But, these glasses fixed them. Try them on,' says the doctor.

'But doc, these glasses don't work for me.

'What do you mean, they work great for me. Try harder'


## Character and Communication
At the heart of communication is character. That's what 'radiates' and creates the foundation of trust between two people ('the emotional bank account'). On the basis of that there can be words, advice or influence. Only at that point technique can be more or less  effective. Technique by itself is useless.

## Empathic Listening
It's listening with your heart and mind with a deep desire to understand emotionally and intellectually. To see the world from the speakers point ### of view. To give a person psychological air. Covey reminds that: 'Satisfied needs do not motivate.' If you can listen with empathy it then allows the door to open to influence.

Empathetic listening is also risky: you have to be vulnerable and open to influence in order to influence others. Which is why again the habits of agency, principle focused ends and effectiveness are so important. They provide the security from which you can be vulnerable and truly listen.  

It's also helpful to clarify what empathic listening is not.  It's not waiting your turn to speak. It's not giving them your autobiography. It's also not that your necessarily agree with someone. There are four other levels of listening that are also not empathic listening: ignoring, pretending, selectively listening, and attentive listening.

The first three are obvious, but the last attentive listening confused me. This is the consulting style 'repeat back what your heard.' Isn't that listening? No because you can do this without really engaging your mind or your heard to understand either the words or the emotions in what they are saying. See more below.

## Four Autobiographical Responses

As it turns out no. Attentive listening is not empathic listening. Covers offers a template as to why. I'll quote here (pg 256)

> Because we listen autobiographically, we tend to respond in one of four ways. We *evaluate* -- we either agree or disagree; we *probe* -- we ask questions from our own frame of reference; we *advise* -- we give counsel based on our own experience; or we *interpret* - we try to figure people out, to explain their motives and behaviors.

I felt like I understood why Tanya was so adverse to my probing.

> Probing is playing twenty questions. It's autobiographical, it controls, and it invades. It's also logical, and the language of logic is different from the language of sentiment and emotion. You can play twenty questions all day and not find out what's important to someone.

### Stages of skill in Listening

Covey then demonstrates through an example conversation between father and son the four stages of empathetic listening. The first explains with the consulting style reflect the words back doesn't quality as empathic listening.

* *Mimic* the words back. Without character or an emotional connection (emotional account) this can be insulting. But at least you're listening to the words if not the emotion below.

* *Rephrase content* This is logical engagement. Better than mimicking because at least you're actually thinking about what they are saying. But still only half.

* *Reflect feeling* This is the other half. You're feeling what they are saying, but not the content.

* *Reflect feeling and content* This combines both. You engage your head and heard to understand the words and the feelings below the words. This gives the psychological air.


## Understanding and Perception

A byproduct of getting better at understanding people is that you'll notice how differently people see the world. The array of paradigms or lenses at play. covey's point is that, given this wide array of viewpoints, it's all the more important for us to try and understand where each of us is coming from. There can be no hope of communication or influence without that.

## Then Seek to be Understood

He reminds that with understanding, the second part is seeking to be understood.

> Earlier we defined maturity as the balance between courage and consideration. Seeking to understand requires consideration; seeking to be understood takes courage. Win/Win requires a high degree of both. So it becomes important in interdependent situations for us to be understood.

Then the question is how best to do this? The key insight here is ethos, pathos and logos.
- **Ethos** is your character. The emotional bank account you have built.
- **Pathos** is feeling. It's considering the emotions of your listener in framing your content.
- **Logos** is the logic.

The sequence matters as well. Most people go straight to logos skipping the other two. Or put logos first before the others. No. You have to build the emotional bank account with people, you have to acknowledge how they are feeling, and only then is the logic relevant.

## One on One

Finally there is a call to proactivity. No need to wait for opportunities to try and understand seek them out. Understanding is in your circle of influence. Complaining, criticizing behind someone's back etc is not. The former increases your circle of influence; the latter reduces.

Covey suggests one on ones for this. Regular discussions with children, spouses, business partners, and so on will give you an opportunity to seek understanding. Don't wait for problems to crop up to do this.

Watch out though.
> Don't push; be patient; be respectful. People don't have to open up verbally before you can empathize. You can empathize all the time with their behavior. You can be discerning, sensitive, and aware that and you can live outside your autobiography when that is needed.
