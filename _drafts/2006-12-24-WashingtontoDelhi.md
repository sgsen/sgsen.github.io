**From the White House...**

Leaving the country for six months is -- as it turns out -- not that easy to do; its something of a logistical nightmare. Where will your mail go? How will I get money over there? What should I do with my car insurance? These are a few of the never ending number of things that I'm trying to figure out and handle. And of course, getting business done during Christmas break is almost futile because like me, nobody is at work. Anyway, suffice it to say that I have 14 days left before I leave for Delhi, and there is much to do.

All of this stuff to do before Delhi has left me little time to think of how it will be to actually be in Delhi. I've seen photos of Delhi so I think I'm somewhat prepared for what it will look like at lease. And I'm almost done reading this book called a City of Djinns by William Dalrymple which is about this British author's year in Delhi. The book is half travel log and half historical perspective. I find that I have some sense of the complicated and variegated history of Delhi having read most of the book. Yet, Delhi like the rest of the country, has changed a great deal since 1993 when this book was written, and this makes it hard to get an idea of what I might there culturally.

There is also the personal aspect in all of this for me in that makes this travel abroad different than other trips I've taken before. This time, I'm not headed to Guatemala or Italy, but to the land of my birth, the land of my ancestors. And, I come as a stranger. A foreigner with an US passport. In Italy I this was expected and fine. But returning to India is ambiguous. Should I really think of myself as leaving home (Washington) or returning home (India)? I suppose one of the motivations of this adventure is to find out.
