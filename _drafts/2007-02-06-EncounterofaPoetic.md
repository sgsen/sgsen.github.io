    I had a chance to see a poetry reading by [Lemn
Sissay](http://senuniversitas.org/publicblog/www.lemnsissay.com) last night at
the IHC in Delhi and I was absolutely blown away by the performance. I know
little if anything about poetry and still I felt the power of his language; it
was absolutely incredible how he got people to laugh and cry with his words.
If you have a chance to see this guy or read some of his poetry I'd absolutely
recommend it.
