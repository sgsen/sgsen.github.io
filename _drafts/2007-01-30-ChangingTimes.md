    I finished the last post talking about what had changed since the last time I
visited my mother's childhood home in the village (Daksinkul), so I want to
pick up from there.Before I start talking about changes and developments, I
think it's important to keep things in the proper perspective. To do that,
here is the picture for today: the entrance to my grandparent's house.

**Roads** Typically, getting there was very much like the rhyme I remember hearing as an example of propositions in English class: "over the mountain and through the woods, to grandma's house we go...". Even into the late 90s, we would have to take a train, then cross a river on a canoe, and then traverse the last bit in a covered cow drawn cart to cover what must be less than 30km from my Aunt's place near a main train station (Gurap for those of you who are familiar with the area.) The whole thing would take more than half a day. Now, the situation is considerably improved. There is a bridge over the river (or it might be a irrigation canal) and there are are also paved (or semi paved) roads pretty much up to the home. **Electricity** This is obviously a big one. Electricity came to the area three or four years ago, but at that time it was being pulled from a line very far away and the resulting voltage was very weak - many others were pulling from the same line I think. The lights would Now it seems that there is a dedicated line for the village and I noted no reduction in voltage. There are power cuts though as there are in all parts of India -- even here in Delhi -- but they seem to occur much less frequently than before. And when one did, I was told not to worry as the power would return in just about an hour. I don't know how my cousin knew that to be the case, but sure enough around just over an hour, the power did return. This is a tremendous improvement indeed if the power cuts now are of a known duration. I remember growing up in Calcutta and often facing power cuts of unknown duration; it's bad enough to not have power, but even worse to not know when it will be back. Incidentally, there were a couple of occasions when the power went out while I was living near Tyson's Corner back in Virginia. During these times my roommate and I would make about a hundred phone calls to Dominion power demanding to know when power would be restored! I won't get into what having electricity means, but suffice it to say that once you have it many, many things become possible such as water pumps, television, and of course lighting (No more kerosene lamps to study under, but they did make an appearance during the power outage.) **Communications** Cell phones were everywhere! This was probably the most noticeable change since my last visit, and it made the rural village feel much closer to everything. I can't describe how odd it felt to talk to my mom in America sitting in a barn. The cell phone (or mobile phones as they are termed here) allows for a whole lot of things (conducting business for one thing) but again, I won't get into the details. Think of how having a cell phone affected your life, and it's much the same here. **Water and Bathrooms** Having studied the importance of drinking water along with the importance of disposing of waste water and solid waste, I'm ashamed to say that I didn't dig into these issues much during my brief visit. I know that we have a pump from which all of the drinking water comes from. But, where this pump is pulling water from, I'm at a loss to explain. The same for where the waste water goes. I can say that within my lifetime going to the bathroom in the village meant going off into the woods and doing my thing, these days there is a private facility within the compound though again, I need to look into how the waste is disposed. **Construction** I should note quickly that the whole structure of the house is made of mud and clay on a bamboo structure. There is roof made of some metal, (tin maybe?) then the roof is covered by the the stalks of wheat or some grain (maybe rice) so that the rain slides off. I'm no architect or construction engineer, but I've wondered for the longest time how these structures hold up during the monsoon rains? I'm told that the rain doesn't directly touch the walls because of the roof, and daily parts of house weakened by the weather are reinforced with more mud. And if there is flooding, then indeed the structures decompose. I'm not entirely satisfied with this explanation, and I plan to dig into this a bit more next time I visit. I'm going to leave off here even though I'm sure I'm forgetting some things. If I remember them some time later, I'll be sure to make note of them, but I'm eager to move on to describing life in Delhi where I'm beginning to settle in quite well. I'll leave you though with a picture of what it looks like inside the housing compound.

You're looking at the pump on one side of the compound. On the left is a
structure where the cooking is done. On the right is main living structure
with three rooms downstairs, and another two upstairs. At the back of the
photo you can see a part of the cow barn. The woman in the photo has been
working at our home for a long time helping out with the daily chores (as
washing dishes).
