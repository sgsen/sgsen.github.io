title: "Notes on The Art of Learning by Josh Waitzkin"

This book has stuck with me and I thought I'd jot down my notes for future reference. I stuck with the book because there was much there that resonated with my own experience. Enough that I felt I could trust the things that were less familiar.

I would say thought that maybe the more apt to call it the Art of Achieving Mastery. Learning is a constant thing. You can do it well or poorly, quickly or slowly. But Mastery is a destination, and it requires learning of a high quality to achieve in a lifetime.

## Introduction

Echoing the concept of primary and secondary greatness that Covey talks about:
> I recognized that being at the pinnacle in other people's eyes had nothing to do with quality of life, and I was drawn to the potential for inner tranquility.  

## I. THE FOUNDATION
### Innocent Moves
You have to have a deep abiding true love for the thing you want to master. It can't come from the outside. Josh loved chess. He loved going to Washington Square park to play. He'd do it for hours playing against the guys there. Then he'd come home and do it again.

Getting better requires leveraging this passion. Not stifling it. Waitzkin gives the example of his coach beginning with letting him play the way he was used to. The way he loved instead of trying to 'teach him' better methods. He'd mold the instruction into the action as they were playing. This also had the key factor of earning Josh's trust and allowing him to be open to instruction. All built on the love for the game that was already there.

Note the keys: teaching/learning starting from where-ever the learner is building on the love. Learning by expressing yourself. And a teacher can only help if they meeting you at this starting point, earn your trust and build on it. The spark has to come from somewhere. Who knows where this comes from. Some essence of your being. And the love has to be sustained. You learn from the place you are in using your own voice.

This is why it's so devastating to fake it in school. It's completely contrary to actually learning.

### Losing to Win

This chapter is about losing and the importance losing has in learning. Failure sparks learning. At Bridgewater the lesson was that pain combined with reflection leads to progress. Note the continuation of the narrative from above. The reason that it's so important to learn through self expression is that if mistakes/failures occur you can readily learn from them.

A second lesson here is that learning from loss is not easy. Failure sparks a lot of pain. A lot of doubt. And to weather this. To be able to manage the pain so that you can actually reflect and learn requires support. Family support. It requires mental and physical space. It requires renewal. Ideally a sacred habit of renewal as Covey might say.

Here's Josh:
> Growing up, I knew that come summertime, we would head off to sea no matter what else was happening in our lives, what crisis was looming, what tournaments I was missing, how out of context or absurd our ocean trips might have felt at the moment of departure. I have come to understand that these little breaks from the competitive intensity of my life have been and still are an integral part of my success. Times at sea are periods of renewal, coming together During those summer months when I questioned everything and decided to come back strong, I arrived at a commitment to chess that was about much more than fun and glory. It was about love and pain and passion and pushing myself to overcome. It might sound absurd, but I believe that year, from eight to nine, was the defining period of my life. I responded to heartbreak with hard work. I was self-motivated and moved by a powerful resolve. While a young boy, I had been all promise. I only knew winning because I was better than all the other children and there was no pressure competing against adults. Now there was the knowledge of my mortality. I had lost to a kid, and there were other children who were also dangerous rivals. With family, being with nature, putting things back in perspective. I am able to let my conscious mind move away from my training, and to gain creative new angles on the next steps of my growth.

> The boating life has also been a wonderful training ground for performance psychology. Living on the water requires constant presence, and the release of control. A boat is always moving with the sea, lurching beneath your feet, and the only way to survive is to sink into rhythm with the waves and be ready for anything. I learned at sea that virtually all situations can be handled as long as presence of mind is maintained. On the other hand, if you lose your calm when crisis hits seventy miles from land, or while swimming with big sharks, there is no safety net to catch you.

> There have been many years when leaving my New York life felt like career suicide—my chess rivals were taking lessons and competing in every weekend tournament while I was on a boat crashing through big waves. But I would come back with new ideas and a full tank of energy and determination. The ocean has always healed me, brought me back to life when I have needed it . . . and as an eight-year-old child in the midst of an existential crisis, I needed it.

Note also the point about presence which comes up time and again. You can't learn without presence.

Finally learning from failure requires resolve and commitment.
> During those summer months when I questioned everything and decided to come back strong, I arrived at a commitment to chess that was about much more than fun and glory. It was about love and pain and passion and pushing myself to overcome. It might sound absurd, but I believe that year, from eight to nine, was the defining period of my life. I responded to heartbreak with hard work. I was self-motivated and moved by a powerful resolve. While a young boy, I had been all promise. I only knew winning because I was better than all the other children and there was no pressure competing against adults. Now there was the knowledge of my mortality. I had lost to a kid, and there were other children who were also dangerous rivals.

### Two Approaches to Learning
This chapter was about what has now become familiar: Carol Dweck's work on whether people have 'fixed' or 'growth' mindsets. In essence do you see your capabilities as being fixed at birth. Or do you see the potential to grow and learn? From things like taking on challenges with your full heart and soul on the line, learning from the outcome whether it's a success or failure.

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/oddqtlc4rrearki/dweck_fixed_growth_mindset.png?dl=0)

If you ask me - if you ask most people - which mindset they have, they'll tell you that: of course, I believe in growth. Why else would I go to college? Obviously I can see that I have learned so much over the years. And so on. But this is all BS. I know looking back, that I went to college to get good grades. These would be external validation or certification of how smart/capable I was. This in turn would convince some future employer or graduate school that I was worth hiring. My career would advance. Just as the same mentality got me from high school to college. High school fraught with a focus on making the grade and participating in every possible 'extracurricular' activity. It wasn't about learning. That was incidental. Assumed. Wouldn't I learn chemistry just by virtue of having gotten a 5 on the AP chem exam? Missing was exploration born of curiosity or love of the subject, any pursuit of deep understanding, and certainly any effort that didn't correlate to a good grade or worse: had the risk of making the grade worse. Better to memorize three formulas in an hour than to spend that same hour deeply understanding one. After all, the test wouldn't reward deep understanding. And so it went.

Here's Josh to the point:

> In my experience, successful people shoot for the stars, put their hearts on the line in every battle, and ultimately discover that the lessons learned from the pursuit of excellence mean much more than the immediate trophies and glory. In the long run, painful losses may prove much more valuable than wins—those who are armed with a healthy attitude and are able to draw wisdom from every experience, “good” or “bad,” are the ones who make it down the road. They are also the ones who are happier along the way. Of course the real challenge is to stay in range of this long-term perspective when you are under fire and hurting in the middle of the war. This, maybe our biggest hurdle, is at the core of the art of learning.

He also tells a story to illustrate the point. He tell the story of going to Arizona for a lecture. The man who organizes him has a boy who is the best chess player in that town. The father proudly proclaims how his son hasn't lost a game in a year. Naturally this boy with moderate talent and early successes wants to keep winning and have people like his father continue to be proud of him. The fixed mindset has laid the deadly trap.

Here's Josh with the rest of the story:

> I knew what was coming—classic anorexic hermit crab. When I met the child, he was a moderately talented boy who was the best in his school. He had learned some quick opening attacks and had a natural feel for basic chess tactics. Clearly he had started winning and had been praised effusively for his genius. As a result, the boy refused to play anyone outside of the circle of friends and competitors whom he knew to be inferior (his favorite opponent was his father, who was a weak player and no challenge at all). To his school buddies, this boy was a chess god, but compared to serious chess-playing children around the country, he had a long way to go. He was a big fish in a small pond and he liked it that way. The boy avoided chess throughout my visit. He didn’t want to play in the simultaneous exhibition and was the only child at the event who was resistant to instruction. His winning streak and the constant talk of it had him all locked up—he was terrified of shattering the façade of perfection. This child was paralyzed by an ever-deepening cycle of entity indoctrination.

> Many kids like this are quite talented, so they excel at first because of good genes—but then they hit a roadblock. As chess struggles become more intense and opponents put up serious resistance, they start to lose interest in the game. They try to avoid challenges, but eventually the real world finds them. Their confidence is fragile. Losing is always a crisis instead of an opportunity for growth—if they were a winner because they won, this new losing must make them a loser.

Moral of the story. You probably believe in the growth mindset, but also probably have been this point at some point in your life. Or like me, too often. But, you can see the pattern, and hopefully change it. It's not easy though. It looks like: being the one person in class who raises their hand and says I don't understand this. It means making the extra effort to go seek out help or drill into some concept a bit longer. Time. Effort. Getting back up again. Getting help. But as Josh says in the first quote, it's at the heart of learning.


### Loving the Game
This section seems primarily written to parents or coaches on how to support and develop their charges without ruining whatever they are doing. I found it relevant in the sense that so often we end up being our own coaches; our own counsel.

He describes a situation where a child has just lost a big match. What is the parent to do? First of all don't say: it doesn't matter.
* **Validate the emotion**. Of course for that child it matters a lot. Why else work so hard for it. It's ok to be sad. Similarly, it's not only ok, but great to celebrate a victory. Be true to the emotion. Give them a hug or jump with joy as the case may be.
* Then when the emotion has settled, you can engage in a **process and effort based conversation to foster learning**. What happened in a loss? Drop in concentration? Impatience? Drop in energy? Etc. This can only really happen if the emotional bank account between the coach and child is already pretty high.

Again this is basically about how to support the ultimate key in learning: putting yourself out there. Giving it your all.

>A heartfelt, empathetically present, incrementally inspiring mom or dad or coach can liberate an ambitious child to take the world by the horns. As adults, we have to take responsibility for ourselves and nurture a healthy, liberated mind-set. We need to put ourselves out there, give it our all, and reap the lesson, win or lose. The fact of the matter is that there will be nothing learned from any challenge in which we don’t try our hardest. Growth comes at the point of resistance. We learn by pushing ourselves and finding what really lies at the outer reaches of our abilities.

### The Soft Zone

Do you bend yourself to the environment and adapt, or are you brittle and inflexible. And therefore suffer. I remember as a kid, I was definitely in the hard zone when it came time to perform. I'd hold my whole body tightly in order to focus on a test. That *was* how I found my edge. Becoming hard. Over the years, I have tried to relax in the moment. Like you are taught in yoga: you can maintain presence, awareness and balance in the midst of intense action. I think that's what Josh is going for here. Again, can you adjust to how the world is. Or do you need a 'cooperative' world to do your thing?

>You are concentrated on the task at hand, whether it be a piece of music, a legal brief, a financial document, driving a car, anything. Then something happens. Maybe your spouse comes home, your baby wakes up and starts screaming, your boss calls you with an unreasonable demand, a truck has a blowout in front of you. The nature of your state of concentration will determine the first phase of your reaction—if you are tense, with your fingers jammed in your ears and your whole body straining to fight off distraction, then you are in a Hard Zone that demands a cooperative world for you to function. Like a dry twig, you are brittle, ready to snap under pressure. The alternative is for you to be quietly, intensely focused, apparently relaxed with a serene look on your face, but inside all the mental juices are churning. You flow with whatever comes, integrating every ripple of life into your creative moment. This Soft Zone is resilient, like a flexible blade of grass that can move with and survive hurricane-force winds.

> Another way of envisioning the importance of the Soft Zone is through an ancient Indian parable that has been quite instructive in my life for many years: A man wants to walk across the land, but the earth is covered with thorns. He has two options—one is to pave his road, to tame all of nature into compliance. The other is to make sandals. Making sandals is the internal solution. Like the Soft Zone, it does not base success on a submissive world or overpowering force, but on intelligent preparation and cultivated resilience.


### The Downward Spiral -> Resilience
This felt like it was something to watch out for. Something that requires the soft zone as a prerequisite. I remember thinking about this when Rashmi was talking about her GMAT. She missed on or two questions and then the rest of the section got away from her. I think this is point about resilience.

> One idea I taught was the importance of regaining presence and clarity of mind after making a serious error. This is a hard lesson for all competitors and performers. The first mistake rarely proves disastrous, but the downward spiral of the second, third, and fourth error creates a devastating chain reaction. Any sports fan has seen professional football, basketball, and baseball games won and lost because of a shift in psychological advantage. People speak about momentum as if it were an entity of its own, an unpredictable player on the field, and from my own competitive experience, I can vouch for it seeming that way. The key is to bring that player onto your team by riding the psychological wave when it is behind you, and snapping back into a fresh presence when your clarity of mind begins to be swept away.

### Numbers to leave Numbers -> Insight/Mastery

> This was the work that I referred to in the Introduction as numbers to leave numbers. Usually long study sessions went like this: I began with the critical position from one of my games, where my intuitive understanding had not been up to the challenge. At first my mind was like a runner on a cold winter morning—stiff, unhappy about the coming jog, dreary. Then I began to move, recalling my attacking ideas in the struggle and how nothing had fully connected. I tried to pick apart my opponent’s position and discovered new layers of his defensive resources, all the while my mind thawing, integrating the evolving structural dynamics it had not quite understood before. Over time my blood started flowing, sweat came, I settled into the rhythm of analysis, soaked in countless patterns of evolving sophistication as I pored over what a computer would consider billions of variations. Like a runner in stride, my thinking became unhindered, free-flowing, faster and faster as I lost myself in the position. Sometimes the study would take six hours in one sitting, sometimes thirty hours over a week. I felt like I was living, breathing, sleeping in that maze, and then, as if from nowhere, all the complications dissolved and I understood.

> When I looked at the critical position from my tournament game, what had stumped me a few days or hours or weeks before now seemed perfectly apparent. I saw the best move, felt the correct plan, understood the evaluation of the position. I couldn’t explain this new knowledge with variations or words. It felt more elemental, like rippling water or a light breeze. My chess intuition had deepened. This was the study of numbers to leave numbers.

> A fascinating offshoot of this method of analysis was that I began to see connections between the leaps of chess understanding and my changing vision of the world. During my study of the critical positions, I noted the feeling I had during the actual chess game. I explained above how in the pressure of tournaments, the tension in the mind mounts with the tension in the position, and an error on the board usually parallels a psychological collapse of sorts. Almost invariably, there was a consistent psychological strain to my errors in a given tournament, and what I began to notice is that my problems on the chessboard usually were manifesting themselves in my life outside of chess.

[]

> I. It is important to understand that by numbers to leave numbers, or form to leave form, I am describing a process in which technical information is integrated into what feels like natural intelligence. Sometimes there will literally be numbers. Other times there will be principles, patterns, variations, techniques, ideas. A good literal example of this process, one that does in fact involve numbers, is a beginner’s very first chess lesson. All chess players learn that the pieces have numerical equivalents—bishops and knights are worth three pawns, a rook is five pawns, a queen is nine. Novices are counting in their heads or on their fingers before they make exchanges. In time, they will stop counting. The pieces will achieve a more flowing and integrated value system. They will move across the board like fields of force. What was once seen mathematically is now felt intuitively.

### Breaking Stallions

>I believe that one of the most critical factors in the transition to becoming a conscious high performer is the degree to which your relationship to your pursuit stays in harmony with your unique disposition. There will inevitably be times when we need to try new ideas, release our current knowledge to take in new information—but it is critical to integrate this new information in a manner that does not violate who we are. By taking away our natural voice, we leave ourselves without a center of gravity to balance us as we navigate the countless obstacles along our way.

## II. MY SECOND ART
### Beginner’s Mind

### Investment in Loss
> Thinking back on my competitive life, I realize how defining these themes of Beginner’s Mind and Investment in Loss have been. Periodically, I have had to take apart my game and go through a rough patch. In all disciplines, there are times when a performer is ready for action, and times when he or she is soft, in flux, broken-down or in a period of growth. Learners in this phase are inevitably vulnerable. It is important to have perspective on this and allow yourself protected periods for cultivation. A gifted boxer with a fabulous right and no left will get beat up while he tries to learn the jab. Or take the talented high school basketball player learning how to play point guard at the college level. He may have been able to dominate schoolyards in his past, but now he has to learn to see the whole court, share the ball, bring the best out of his teammates. If a young athlete is expected to perform brilliantly in his first games within this new system, he will surely disappoint. He needs time to internalize the new skills before he will improve. The same can be said about a chess player adjusting to a new opening repertoire, a martial artist learning a new technique, or a golfer, for example Tiger Woods, taking apart his swing in order to make a long-term improvement.

> How can we incorporate these ideas into the real world? In certain competitive arenas—our working lives, for example—there are seldom weeks in which performance does not matter. Similarly, it is not so difficult to have a beginner’s mind and to be willing to invest in loss when you are truly a beginner, but it is much harder to maintain that humility and openness to learning when people are watching and expecting you to perform. True enough. This was a huge problem for me in my chess career after the movie came out. Psychologically, I didn’t give myself the room to invest in loss.

> My response is that it is essential to have a liberating incremental approach that allows for times when you are not in a peak performance state. We must take responsibility for ourselves, and not expect the rest of the world to understand what it takes to become the best that we can become. Great ones are willing to get burned time and again as they sharpen their swords in the fire. Consider Michael Jordan. It is common knowledge that Jordan made more last-minute shots to win the game for his team than any other player in the history of the NBA. What is not so well known, is that Jordan also missed more last-minute shots to lose the game for his team than any other player in the history of the game. What made him the greatest was not perfection, but a willingness to put himself on the line as a way of life. Did he suffer all those nights when he sent twenty thousand Bulls fans home heartbroken? Of course. But he was *willing to look bad* on the road to basketball immortality.

My emphasis there on the willing to look bad bit. I find it essential. To put yourself on the line. To fail. In order to get better.

### Making Smaller Circles
He points out that martial hands masters don't make grand, theatrical moves that you see in movies. They pack an enormous amount of power into small movements. They have captured the essence of those movements. Transformed it into a feeling. Josh describes learning how to do the straight forward punch until he had internalized it into a feeling of the ground striking through him.


The idea is depth over breadth. Understand and master something in it's most basic essential. And see that the macro is just a combination of a lot of these micro pieces.

> The theme is depth over breadth. The learning principle is to plunge into the detailed mystery of the micro in order to understand what makes the macro tick.

To quote:

> My understanding of this process, in the spirit of my numbers to leave numbers method of chess study, is to touch the essence (for example, highly refined and deeply internalized body mechanics or feeling) of a technique, and then to incrementally condense the external manifestation of the technique while keeping true to its essence. Over time expansiveness decreases while potency increases. I call this method “Making Smaller Circles.”


### Using Adversity

> One thing I have learned as a competitor is that there are clear distinctions between what it takes to be decent, what it takes to be good, what it takes to be great, and what it takes to be among the best. If your goal is to be mediocre, then you have a considerable margin for error.

> When aiming for the top, your path requires an engaged, searching mind. You have to make obstacles spur you to creative new angles in the learning process. Let setbacks deepen your resolve.

> Even people who are completely devoted to cultivating a certain discipline often fall into a mental rut, a disengaged lifestyle that implies excellence can be obtained by going through the motions. We lose presence. Then an injury or some other kind of setback throws a wrench into the gears. We are forced to get imaginative.

> Once we learn how to use adversity to our advantage, we can manufacture the helpful growth opportunity without actual danger or injury. I call this tool the internal solution—we can notice external events that trigger helpful growth or performance opportunities, and then internalize the effects of those events without their actually happening. In this way, adversity becomes a tremendous source of creative inspiration.



### Slowing Down Time

> For much of this book I have described my vision of the road to mastery—you start with the fundamentals, get a solid foundation fueled by understanding the principles of your discipline, then you expand and refine your repertoire, guided by your individual predispositions, while keeping in touch, however abstractly, with what you feel to be the essential core of the art. What results is a network of deeply internalized, interconnected knowledge that expands from a central, personal locus point. The question of intuition relates to how that network is navigated and used as fuel for creative insight.

> Most people would be surprised to discover that if you compare the thought process of a Grandmaster to that of an expert (a much weaker, but quite competent chess player), you will often find that the Grandmaster consciously looks at less, not more. That said, the chunks of information that have been put together in his mind allow him to see much more with much less conscious thought. So he is looking at very little and seeing quite a lot. This is the critical idea.

> ibility. On the other hand, armed with an understanding of how intuition operates, we can train ourselves to have remarkably potent perceptual and physical abilities in our disciplines of focus. The key, of course, is practice.


> I. A technical example of how this might function in chess is for a player to consider a pair of opposing bishops on a semi-open chessboard. There is a huge amount of information which is fundamental to deciphering the dynamics of those two bishops—that is, central pawn structure, surrounding pieces, potential trades, possible transitions to closed or open games or to endgames of varying pawn structures, initiative, king safety, principles of interpreting these principles, principles of interpreting those interpretive principles, and so on. For the Grandmaster the list is very long. For the expert, it is relatively short. But more importantly, the Grandmaster has a much more highly evolved navigational system, so he can sort through his expansive network of bishop-related knowledge in a flash (he sees bishop and immediately processes all related information), while the expert has to labor through a much smaller amount of data with much more effort. The Grandmaster looks at less and sees more, because his unconscious skill set is much more highly evolved.

### The Illusion of the Mystical

> In time, I have come to understand those words, At the opponent’s slightest move, I move first, as pertaining to intention—reading and ultimately controlling intention. The deepest form of adherence or shadowing involves a switching of roles, where the follower becomes the followed in a relationship in which time seems to twist in a tangle of minds—this is how the great Tai Chi or Aikido artist guides the opponent into a black hole, or appears to psychically impel the other to throw himself on the ground.

## Working relationship with emotions

This resonated. Parallels work with Lee. Learn to befriend emotions. Will keep you feeling connected to moment, will enable learning, appropriate action. Instead of running away or acting out from a place of fear (like I do: lashing out)
