    I keep thinking that I will find time to write a few more entries and then
this blog will be up to the present moment. Well, right now I'm about four
weeks behind and with all the traveling I've been doing I've found it
difficult to get online and write. So while I will keep slowly plodding along
to get salient experiences up in written form, I've decided to just start
putting up photos from a few of the places I've been to a la photo blog style.
Here then are some photos I took at the [Golden Temple in Amritsar,
Punjab](http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amritsar:Golden_Temple).
