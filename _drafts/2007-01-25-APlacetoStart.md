I’ve been here on the ground for just over two weeks and now that I finally have some – albeit limited – internet access, I am trying to figure out how to best convey my experiences so far. And already I’m finding it hard to do. I
think one of my coworkers visiting from Canada summed it up best when he
observed that India is something that a person has to see to believe. I think
he’s right because before I came to India, I read about it, I watched movies
about it, I had seen pictures of it, and still India blew my mind as soon as I
stepped foot on it’s soil. Difficult thought the experiences may be to
transmit, I’m determined to try. If for no other reason than for my own future
record, so setting aside my usual perfectionist tendencies, I am just going to
start with this picture (where I suppose it all started for my mother), and
get to the rest one short bit at a time.

This is a photo a cousin of mine took of me examining the potato crop, but
these aren’t any old potatoes. They are growing on land my family has owned for
years very near to my mother’s ancestral home in rural West Bengal. Yes, these
are our potatoes! (Watch out Idaho!) We're also growing mustard at the moment.

But, I’m jumping a bit too far ahead. I’ll dig into details later, but the
broad strokes are these. I got to Delhi on Tuesday (1/9/07), and after setting
up shop a bit in my new digs and checking in at work, I headed to West Bengal
on the eastern side of the country to see my family. Calcutta is the capital
of West Bengal and is some 1500 km from Delhi, and I headed there by train (this was
some experience, and I’ll write more on the trip later) because it was too
short notice for me to acquire reasonably priced plane tickets. 18 hours
later, I reached Howrah, one of the two main stations serving Calcutta. From
there, I took another local train to my Aunt’s house. I stayed there for a day
or so and caught up with members of my family that come to see me. Then, I
hired a car to take me to my mother’s ancestral home in Daksinkul.

I always go there to see my grandparents and my mom’s brother’s family. He is the one that
still runs the family farm, and on the second day that I was there, I got the
tour of the farm and the picture was taken. Every time I return to Daksinkul,
I am struck by how beautiful the country side is. There are no buildings
obstructing your view, and you look out as far as the eye can see, across
miles and miles of farmland just like the one in the photo. At night, there
are hardly any lights and there is an absolutely spectacular view of the
stars. Much has changed since the time my mother grew up on the farm and I’ll
write a bit about that next time, but for the moment here are a few more
photos I took en route to my mother’s village.
