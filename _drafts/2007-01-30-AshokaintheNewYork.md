    I remember a lot of you wondering what work I was doing down here in Delhi,
and I was planning on getting to it later here on the blog. But, with great
surprise and excitement I just noticed that Nicholas Kristof has prominently
written about the organization I'm working for, Ashoka, in the New York Times
today! So I had to make a brief note about that and give you all a [link to
the article](http://select.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/opinion/30kristof.html). If
you don't subscribe to the Times, you can download a PDF of the article from
[here](http://senuniversitas.org/publicfiles/NYTimes_Kristof_Ashoka.pdf). It
does a good job of describing some of what [Ashoka](http://ashoka.org) does
generally, and I specifically work for the [Law for All
Initiative](http://ashoka.org/lawforall). I use the word "work" operatively,
but I think volunteer/intern/lend a hand would be much more accurate. I think
I mentioned to a few of you that I haven't had a chance to really get started
on much in the four days I've worked so far, but it has certainly been
inspirational. Just looking at what the [Ashoka fellows are doing in India
](http://ashoka.org/search/fellows?country=IN&)alone will make the reason
obvious. I'll talk more about social entrepreneurship and my work when I get
more settled in, but this should give you all some idea. I can't close without
mentioning that I had a chance to hear Muhammad Yunus speak today from ten
feet away and it was pretty amazing, but more on that later.
