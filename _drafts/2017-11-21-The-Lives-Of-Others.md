Finished these books over the last couple of months

Both affected me. I found them similar.

- fight for a cause
  - a nationalist cause in the case of Biafra
  - a class/economic cause in the case of the Naxals
  - at their root both are political causes
  - what’s the difference really between the economic and political? don’t they go hand in hand? Isn’t the political generally borne of the economic? Fight for oil. Or water. Or Forests. Or farmland.
  - What was the Naxalite uprising about?
      - the owners or the land who live prosperous lives (all relative I suppose). Roof. Food. Clothes. Basic health care. Schools. Some leisure time.
      - Those who work the land. Dying of destitution.
  - What was the thing in Biafra about?
- idealistic characters who lose their idealism
  - I could feel a connection to both characters.
  - No. Not just a connection. I could have been them. I could be the young idealistic student with a bright future in the existing system. Who gives that up to fight with the Naxals.
  - Or the middle class intellectual who
  - Supratik and the servant
  - Odenigbo and Ugwu though Ugwu comes out much more triumphantly
- The Biafrans lose as do the Naxals
- The values and events around the Naxalite period deeply influenced my parents and through them: me.
  - identifying with farmers
  - identifying with the struggle of the have-nots
  - keenly sensitive to social justice issues
  - feeling an obligation to fight for the poor and sacrifice for them
  - that a life worth living is to fight those with power
  - that those with power are corrupt who exploit and oppress the poor.
- Reading the book is somehow feels like seeing a script of a play. Except I’m in that play. I can see the strings of the puppet master. I question whether or not I really believe these things that I do. Whether I want to do the things that I do. Or is it just the director in the form of inherited values
- Is it futile to oppose power structures? Is it honorable?
- Can a puppet move it self once it cuts the strings to the puppet master. What would such a puppet do?


Conversation with Sonya Nov 18, 2017 re: Lives of others

Sonya is really the only other person I know who has read the book.
In conversation, it occurred to me that maybe the book’s title was about peering into the lives of others. Makes the point that despite living in close proximity to people, we hardly know what their lives are like. In the same house there are three generations plus the servants. All are living separate, interconnecting lives. None are really aware of what the others are doing. If this is true for people in a house. This extends then to those outside the house. Far off villages where farmers are suffering. Between landlords and farmers.

Additional questions on the point. People seem to be so automatically, so naturally oblivious to the lives of others. This is the default state. How can there be the mutual concern and understanding required for justice in modern societies. Or can there not be? That the default state is injustice, cruelty and indifference.

And suppose we somehow become aware of the lives of others by reading a book or having some extraordinary experience (eg. travel, education, work), what are we supposed to do about it? Suprateek and Odenigbo have had their conciousness raised in some way. And then they strive for justice with violence. Individual/group violence in once case and war in the other. Is that the right thing to do?

Another point that came from the conversation was about the servant. I was confused as to why he killed himself. Hearing Sonya’s perspective made it seem obvious. This man was effectively living the lives of others. Separated from his own people and family to be a full time servant in the Ghosh house. He then gets thrown out; betrayed. He can’t go back. And without any means of an income how can we go to this family he hardly knows. There is no where for him. The book opens and closes with a man taking his own life when he has run out of options.
