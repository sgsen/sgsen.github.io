### Development As Freedom -- Ch 4 Poverty as Capability Deprivation

Sen decouples viewing poverty only as income distribution. He does not deny the fact that income distribution can indeed be the cause of poverty, just that it need not be viewed as the only cause because other causes certainly exist. There are other factors by which to measure poverty that Sen believes are intrinsically important as opposed to income which is only instrumentally important. That is, money is useful insofar as it allows someone to purchase some good that has intrinsic value; by itself money is rather useless. More importantly, the relationship between low income and poverty is complex and varies by location, families, or even individuals.

Also the conversion rate from income to capability differs from one individual to another. I think Sen is trying to say that it costs more to allow an sick old man to walk than a young child. So while the capability is the same: walking, the income is not. This brings to the forefront the concept of 'real poverty' which may actually be worse than is indicated by the income based indicators.

Indeed Sen says that distribution within a family may not be equal even if there is some sort of predominant gender bias. This typically manifests itself as male bias in the east, but Sen points out by way of an example, such a bias also exists in the west. Finally if you are relatively poor there may be absolute capability deprivations. Blacks in America are relatively rich compared to the poor of the world, but in comparison to whites in America they are relatively poor. As such, the overall cost of living might force them to suffer capability deprivations.

### Development As Freedom -- Ch 6 The Importance of Democracy

In addressing the question of whether political freedoms or economic development in poor countries should be emphasized Sen essentially agues that it should not be a question of one or the other because there are many important interconnections between the two and it is helpful to pursue both ends together.

The conventional argument is that when you don\'t have basic sustenance you care about economic development more than human rights which you can't really use anyway if you're hungry.

Sen argues that economic needs add to the need for political liberties because of the following considerations (148):
* Direct importance in human living associated with these capabilities (including political and social participation)

* Instrumental role in enhancing the hearing people get in expressing and supporting their claims to political attention (including their claims of economic needs)

* Constructive role in the conceptualization of needs (including the understanding of “economic needs” in a social context.

But, before supporting these considerations for this dual pronged approach he attacks three of the most common reasons supporting the conventional viewpoint of economic need first, liberties next. He argues against:

* Freedoms and rights hamper economic growth and development

* If poor people are given a choice between having political freedoms or fulfilling economic needs, they invariably choose the later. (This argument again requires people to think that the two ideas of freedom and economic development are deeply separate and that it must be one or the other.)

* Emphasis on political freedoms is a western value contrary to the more discipline/order oriented values of the East. (He addresses this in Chapter 10)
