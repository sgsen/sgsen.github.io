### Notes on The Psychology of Human Misjudgment

 Speech given by Charlie Munger of Berkshire Hathaway to Harvard Law School

 I find human psychology fascinating. Perhaps the most interesting subject of all. What does sociology, philosophy, government, economics, etc have in common if not a base in human psychology. I am amazed how often this crucial subject is ignored by the other subjects. I have written previously that the question of greatest importance to me right now is the age old question of "what constitutes the ideal life." More essentially: how should one live? I have put some significant quantity of thought into this question and I find that there are really two sets of answers. One is from the religion/moral/justice/parental angle which essentially tries to guide our behavior towards the ideal. Then there is the actual way people do things which I find is the realm of economics and germane to this essay, psychology.

 Munger is a vice chairman at Berkshire Hathaway and a billionaire himself. His biography can be found on the web so I won\'t bother repeating it here, but I will say that it is evident this man is bright and from reading this article it is clear that he knows what he is talking about and is worth listening to. As such, I thought I would record my notes on Munger\'s twenty four factors detrimental to human judgment. They are not really his original ideas, but I come across these ideas in his speech for the first time, so I will attribute them to him until corrected.

 The pith of his lecture seemed to be that human judgment is fallible in many ways. Any important decision be it investing or choosing a restaurant is influenced by the factors he identifies. Indeed disastrous decisions are usually made when a number of these factors are present in combination. He says that it is worthwhile to be aware of common pitfalls resulting quite simply from how the human brain is wired so as to be able to avoid them. He says that all of these psychological effects work on the subconscious level making them very insidious.

 1. **Incentives.** People do things to get things essentially, and it is critical to understand in a situation what the incentives are. Typically identifying the incentives will allow someone to identify probable behavior.

 2. **Psychological Denial.** This often results when the pain of bearing something is too great and its just a whole lot easier to deny the pain.

 3. **Incentive Caused Bias**. For example, if you are selling something to someone you are more likely to err on the side of making your product look good as opposed to otherwise. A real estate agent is not going to tell you a house is not worth the money.

 4. **Bias from consistency and commitment tendency.** The human mind likes to latch onto ideas that it has understood or created. After that it is resistant to alternative ideas. Professors who have worked hard to prove an idea would be hard pressed to present proof rejected their claim.

 5. **Bias from Pavlovian Association.** So basically if you associate x with y, every time you get x you will expect y.

 6. **Reciprocation Tendency.** Ask for a lot and then back off. Role theory suggests that people tend to act in a way that other people expect. Stanford Prison Experiment.

 7.  **Social Proof.** That people (particularly under stress and uncertainty) tend to look around and do what everybody else is doing. I would think that this usually leads to mass paralysis because everybody else is also looking around. Since nobody is doing anything, nobody starts doing anything. Or in some cases, say fashion, a few start doing something and before you know it everybody is doing that.

 8.  Math Bias. Not very clearly explained.

 9.  **Contrast Bias** Remember when you got to UVa you heard Casteen tell this story of a girl who wrote back to her parents about how college was going and she wrote that she had gotten pregnant, failed her classes, and so on. The student then proceeded to conclude the letter saying essentially "just kidding about all of this, but I am getting a C in this one class." The effect was to greatly minimize the impact of that C, it's a lot better than the scenarios she painted early on.

 10. **Bias from Over Influence by Authority.** In a nutshell remember the Milgrim experiment or what happened in Nazi Germany.11. **Bias from Deprival Super-Reaction Syndrome.** This includes bias caused by present or threatened scarcity, including threatened removal of something almost possessed, but never possessed. He gives the example of labor negotiations and compares it to trying to take something away from a dog once he has it. "People are really crazy about minor decrements down."

 12. **Bias from envy/jealousy.** Munger quotes Buffet in saying that "It's not greed that drives the world, but envy."

 13. **Bias from Chemical Dependency.** Pretty self explanatory.

 14. **Bias from Misgambling compusion.** Lotteries where you get to pick your numbers get big play, you think you have some control (commitment and consistency). Or near misses on the slot machine give you that feeling that you almost got it, and you surely will next time (deprival super-reaction syndrome). Machines in Vegas are built on this.15. **Bias from liking distortion.** Tendency to like oneself or ideas that are your own. Incentive caused bias. Being misled by someone you like. Happens in relationships all the time I think; you're going to listen to somebody you know as opposed to someone you don't.

 16. **Bias from the non-** mathematical nature of brain in its natural state as it deals with probabilities employing crude heuristics. Mislead by contrast. Overweigh conveniently available information. Availability is an example of this overweighing available information. Coke made a killing by making the product available everywhere. I put carrots in my room because I'll eat more of them if they are in front of me. Need to fire people that are too susceptible to this.

 17. **Over-influence by extra-vivid evidence.** Someone right in front of you will have more influence on you than somebody on the phone.

 18. **Not asking why or having the wrong answer to the question.** Mental confusion caused by information not arrayed in the mind and theory structures, creating sound generalizations developed in response to the question "Why?" Also, mis-influence from information that apparently, but not really answers the question "Why?" Finally, failure to obtain deserved influence caused by not properly explaining why.

 19. Bias from other normal limitations of sensation, memory, cognition, and knowledge.

 20.  **Stress-induced mental changes, small and large, temporary and permanent.** This one is one that I'm more than sufficiently familiar with.

 21. Common Mental Illnesses and Declines including the tendency to lose ability through disuse.

 22. **Development and Organizational confusion from say-something syndrome.** People who are incoherent and unable to communicate should not be involved in decisions.

 Some notes Munger makes in summarization.

 1\. Watch out for situations where a number of these tendencies tend to combine.

 2\. He makes some comment about the **system of Euclid** and how there are overlaps. I need to look into this.

 3\. He spoke about the use of all of this, if these tendencies are ingrained in us genetically. He says that from a survival point of view these tendencies probably help us otherwise they wouldn't have survived genetically. But, if the tendencies are understood we may use it make better decisions. Keep them in mind when designing human systems. Founding fathers understood a bunch of these in trying to set up government. Lot of times these tendencies work subconsciously and so you can even use these to manipulate yourself for the better. Do the most unpleasant stuff first for example applying the whole carrot and stick tendency.

 4\. Economics and Psychology obviously interrelate!

 5\. Who is [Jacob Viner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Viner)

 Finally there is one interesting comment Munger makes regarding wealth which I really found to resonate with my own thinking (bias from liking distortion haha).
 >"I wanted to get rich so I could be independent, and so, I could do other things like give talks on the intersection of psychology and economics. I didn't want to turn it into a total obsession."
