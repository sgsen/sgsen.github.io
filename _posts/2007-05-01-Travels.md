(Date is a guess)
I've managed to squeeze in a fair amount of traveling over the nearly four
months I've been here so far, but not as much as I had planned. I mostly
attribute this to two causes: one environmental and one personal. As I've
previous occasion to note, it is hot outside. And it has been this way for
sometime now. I can understand why the Lonely Planet does not recommend
touring India between April and August.
