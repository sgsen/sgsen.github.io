These days I'm trying to find ways to improve access to finance for small businesses in India.

I'm a mix of researcher and practitioner at heart interested in bridging thinking to action and helping governments and markets work for the poor both here and abroad. The constellation of issues related to food security, nutrition, agriculture and community development are particular passions of mine.

I enjoy strategic thinking, writing, quantitative analysis and have an enthusiasm for entrepreneurship and management. I've followed these interests to build a local non profit and work with Ashoka - an international non-profit - code at a tech start up, lead research at the World Bank, and most recently, to try my hand at management at Bridgewater, a hedge fund.

I studied engineering and economics in college at the University of Virginia. And in graduate school, I focused on international development, economics and policy at the Harvard Kennedy School (MPA/ID). I spent a semester during that time at MIT's Sloan School of Management learning about finance.
