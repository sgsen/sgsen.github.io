                I have been working on building up my data science skills lately. A bulk of what's beloare the small projects I've done as I work through the Dataquest curriculum.

                I see this learning as an extension of the econometric work I had done in graduate school and then applied in various work assignments - mostly in the form of analytical papers for the World Bank but also recently at a food and grocery start up. Some key outpouts from those efforts are included below as well.
